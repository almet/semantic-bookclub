    <!-- Book definition.

         A book can have a number of properties, but does not need to be
         defined here. For instance, a book can have an id, a title, an author,
         a publisher, a publication year and a subject.

         A new class is defined for the book concept because it is not exactly
         the same thing than just a physical resource as defined by dct.

         All of them can be defined using:

             * dct:identifier
             * dct:title
             * dct:creator
             * dct:publisher
             * dct:issued
             * dtc:subject
    !-->
    <rdfs:Class rdf:ID="Book">
        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="dct:PhysicalResource" />
    </rdfs:Class>

    <!-- Member definition.

         A member is a subset of foaf:Person, because it is more specialized.
         (Being a Member implies to be a person, but the other way around is
         not true)

         Similarily to the book, a member do have a number of properties that
         can be reused from other vocabularies, so they are not defined in this
         schema
         
         * foaf:givenName
         * foaf:familyName.
         * foaf:mbox
         * foaf:knows
         * book:ownsCopyOf
    !-->
    <rdfs:Class rdf:ID="Member">
        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="foaf:Person" />
    </rdfs:Class>

    <!-- Loan definition.

         A Loan is a concept which is not defined by neither foaf or
         dublin-core, so it is redefined here.

         Only the date property is reused here, from dct:date. The other
         propertues are redefined for this vocabulary.
